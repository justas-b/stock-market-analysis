# Stock Market Performance

### Welcome to my stock market performance application!
### This uses the [Alpha Vantage API](https://www.alphavantage.co/documentation/) to extract information from various stocks. Please generate you own API using the following [link](https://www.alphavantage.co/support/#api-key), and replace the commented API_KEY with your generated key if you wish this application!

### This application makes use of the [Rich](https://rich.readthedocs.io/en/stable/introduction.html) library to display information about stocks within your terminal - please ensure to have to installed.
